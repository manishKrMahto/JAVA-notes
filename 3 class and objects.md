# Classes and objects: 

## <u>Declaring classes </u>
### Declaring Classes in Java

In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that its objects will have. Declaring a class involves specifying its name, its fields, its methods, and any other nested classes or interfaces.

#### Basic Structure of a Class
Here's a simple example of a class declaration in Java:

```java
public class Car {
    // Fields (Attributes)
    private String color;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String color, String model, int year) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Methods (Behaviors)
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car is driving.");
    }

    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Car model: " + model + ", Year: " + year + ", Color: " + color);
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    public int getYear() {
        return year;
    }

    public void setYear(int year) {
        this.year = year;
    }
}
```

#### Components of a Class

1. **Class Declaration**
   - The class declaration starts with the `class` keyword followed by the class name (e.g., `Car`). The class name should be a noun that describes the objects it will create.

2. **Fields**
   - Fields, also known as attributes or properties, represent the state of the class. They are typically private to adhere to the principle of encapsulation.
   ```java
   private String color;
   private String model;
   private int year;
   ```

3. **Constructor**
   - A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It usually initializes the fields of the class.
   ```java
   public Car(String color, String model, int year) {
       this.color = color;
       this.model = model;
       this.year = year;
   }
   ```

4. **Methods**
   - Methods define the behavior of the class. They perform operations on the fields and can return values.
   ```java
   public void drive() {
       System.out.println("The car is driving.");
   }

   public void displayDetails() {
       System.out.println("Car model: " + model + ", Year: " + year + ", Color: " + color);
   }
   ```

5. **Getters and Setters**
   - Getters and setters provide controlled access to the fields of the class. They are methods that retrieve and modify the field values, respectively.
   ```java
   public String getColor() {
       return color;
   }

   public void setColor(String color) {
       this.color = color;
   }
   ```

#### Access Modifiers
- **public**: The class, method, or field is accessible from any other class.
- **private**: The field or method is accessible only within the class it is declared.
- **protected**: The field or method is accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **default (no modifier)**: The field or method is accessible only within the same package.

#### Example Usage
Here's how you might use the `Car` class in a `main` method:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Toyota", 2021);
        myCar.drive();
        myCar.displayDetails();

        // Accessing fields via getters and setters
        myCar.setColor("Blue");
        System.out.println("Updated color: " + myCar.getColor());
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `Car` class, call its methods, and manipulate its fields using the provided getters and setters.

### Summary
Declaring a class in Java involves defining its fields, constructors, methods, and any other necessary components. Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of these components. By following these principles, you can create well-structured, encapsulated classes that serve as the building blocks of your Java applications.

## <u> creating objects </u>
### Creating Objects in Java

In Java, creating an object is known as instantiation. When you create an object, you're making an instance of a class. This process involves three steps: declaration, instantiation, and initialization.

#### Steps to Create an Object

1. **Declaration**: Declare a variable to hold the object.
2. **Instantiation**: Use the `new` keyword to allocate memory for the object.
3. **Initialization**: Call the class constructor to initialize the object.

Here's a simple example of creating an object:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declaration
        Car myCar;
        
        // Instantiation and Initialization
        myCar = new Car("Red", "Toyota", 2021);
        
        // Using the object
        myCar.drive();
        myCar.displayDetails();
    }
}
```

Let's break down the example:

### 1. Declaration

This step declares a variable of type `Car` but does not yet create the object.

```java
Car myCar;
```

### 2. Instantiation and Initialization

This step creates the actual object using the `new` keyword and calls the constructor to initialize the object.

```java
myCar = new Car("Red", "Toyota", 2021);
```

- **`new Car("Red", "Toyota", 2021)`**: The `new` keyword allocates memory for the new `Car` object.
- **`Car("Red", "Toyota", 2021)`**: This calls the constructor of the `Car` class, initializing the object's fields with the provided values.

You can combine the declaration and instantiation/initialization in one step:

```java
Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Toyota", 2021);
```

### Using the Object

After creating an object, you can use its methods and access its fields (typically through getters and setters).

```java
myCar.drive();
myCar.displayDetails();
```

### Multiple Objects

You can create multiple instances (objects) of the same class. Each object is independent and has its own state.

```java
Car car1 = new Car("Red", "Toyota", 2021);
Car car2 = new Car("Blue", "Honda", 2019);

car1.drive();
car2.drive();
```

### Example with a Full Class

Let's see a complete example with the `Car` class and how we create and use objects.

```java
public class Car {
    private String color;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    public Car(String color, String model, int year) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car is driving.");
    }

    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Car model: " + model + ", Year: " + year + ", Color: " + color);
    }

    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    public int getYear() {
        return year;
    }

    public void setYear(int year) {
        this.year = year;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Toyota", 2021);
        myCar.drive();
        myCar.displayDetails();
        
        Car anotherCar = new Car("Blue", "Honda", 2019);
        anotherCar.drive();
        anotherCar.displayDetails();
    }
}
```

### Summary

Creating objects in Java involves:
1. Declaring a variable to reference the object.
2. Instantiating the object using the `new` keyword.
3. Initializing the object via a constructor.

By following these steps, you can create and manipulate objects, allowing you to utilize the power of object-oriented programming in Java.

## <u>declaring objects </u>
<p>already covered </p>

## <u>declaring methods </u>
### Declaring Methods in Java

Methods in Java are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are used to define the behavior of objects created from a class. Declaring a method involves specifying its name, return type, parameters, and the body of the method where the actual implementation resides.

#### Basic Structure of a Method

Here's a simple method declaration in Java:

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Method declaration
    public void myMethod() {
        // Method body
        System.out.println("This is my method.");
    }
}
```

### Components of a Method

1. **Access Modifier**
   - Determines the visibility of the method. Common access modifiers include:
     - `public`: The method can be accessed from any other class.
     - `private`: The method can only be accessed within the same class.
     - `protected`: The method can be accessed within the same package and by subclasses.
     - Default (no modifier): The method can be accessed within the same package.

2. **Return Type**
   - Specifies the type of value the method returns. If the method does not return any value, the return type is `void`.

3. **Method Name**
   - The name of the method, which should be a verb that describes what the method does. Method names should follow the camelCase convention.

4. **Parameters**
   - A comma-separated list of input parameters for the method, enclosed in parentheses. Each parameter must have a type and a name. If there are no parameters, empty parentheses `()` are used.

5. **Method Body**
   - The block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}` that defines what the method does. This is where the method's logic is implemented.

### Example of Method Declaration

Hereâ€™s a class with several methods demonstrating different aspects of method declaration:

```java
public class Calculator {

    // Method with no parameters and void return type
    public void printWelcomeMessage() {
        System.out.println("Welcome to the Calculator!");
    }

    // Method with parameters and a return type
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Method with multiple parameters and a return type
    public double divide(double numerator, double denominator) {
        if (denominator != 0) {
            return numerator / denominator;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Error: Division by zero.");
            return 0;
        }
    }

    // Private method
    private void logOperation(String operation) {
        System.out.println("Operation performed: " + operation);
    }
}
```

### Using Methods

To use the methods declared in a class, you need to create an instance of the class (unless the methods are static, which we'll cover later). Hereâ€™s how you can call the methods from the `Calculator` class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        
        // Calling a method with no parameters
        calculator.printWelcomeMessage();
        
        // Calling a method with parameters and capturing the return value
        int sum = calculator.add(5, 3);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        
        // Calling a method with multiple parameters and capturing the return value
        double quotient = calculator.divide(10.0, 2.0);
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + quotient);
    }
}
```

### Static Methods

Static methods belong to the class rather than any instance. They can be called without creating an instance of the class. To declare a static method, use the `static` keyword:

```java
public class MathUtils {

    // Static method
    public static int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}
```

You can call static methods directly using the class name:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = MathUtils.multiply(5, 3);
        System.out.println("Product: " + result);
    }
}
```

### Overloading Methods

Method overloading allows you to declare multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. This can be useful for providing different ways to perform a similar operation.

```java
public class Printer {

    // Overloaded methods
    public void print(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }

    public void print(int number) {
        System.out.println(number);
    }

    public void print(double value) {
        System.out.println(value);
    }
}
```

### Summary

Declaring methods in Java involves specifying the access modifier, return type, method name, parameters, and the method body. Methods encapsulate behavior, can return values, and can be overloaded to handle different types of input. Static methods belong to the class itself and can be called without creating an instance.

## <u>passing arguments to methods </u>
In Java, arguments can be passed to methods in two main ways: by value and by reference. However, Java strictly adheres to the "pass-by-value" approach, which means that the actual value of the argument is passed. Understanding how this works with both primitive data types and reference types (objects) is crucial for correctly managing data in your programs.

### 1. Passing Primitive Data Types
When you pass a primitive data type (e.g., `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, etc.) to a method, the actual value is passed, not the variable itself. This means that any changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original variable.

#### Example:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5;
        modifyPrimitive(number);
        System.out.println("After method call: " + number); // Output: 5
    }

    public static void modifyPrimitive(int num) {
        num = 10;
    }
}
```
In this example, `number` remains `5` even after the `modifyPrimitive` method call because the method works on a copy of the `number` value.

### 2. Passing Reference Types
When you pass an object (reference type) to a method, the reference (address) to the object is passed by value. This means that the method receives a copy of the reference to the object, not the actual object. Changes made to the object's fields inside the method will affect the original object because both the original reference and the method's reference point to the same object in memory.

#### Example:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyObject obj = new MyObject();
        obj.value = 5;
        modifyObject(obj);
        System.out.println("After method call: " + obj.value); // Output: 10
    }

    public static void modifyObject(MyObject o) {
        o.value = 10;
    }
}

class MyObject {
    int value;
}
```
In this example, the `value` field of `obj` is changed to `10` because `modifyObject` works with the reference to the same `MyObject` instance.

### Key Points to Remember
- **Primitive Types**: The method receives a copy of the actual value. Changes to this value inside the method do not affect the original variable.
- **Reference Types**: The method receives a copy of the reference to the object. Changes to the object's fields inside the method affect the original object.

### Misconceptions Clarified
It's important to note that Java does not support pass-by-reference as it is understood in some other languages (like C++). In Java, the reference itself is passed by value, meaning the method cannot reassign the original reference to a new object. It can only modify the object that the reference points to.

#### Example:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyObject obj = new MyObject();
        obj.value = 5;
        reassignObject(obj);
        System.out.println("After method call: " + obj.value); // Output: 5
    }

    public static void reassignObject(MyObject o) {
        o = new MyObject();
        o.value = 10;
    }
}
```
In this example, `obj.value` remains `5` after the method call because the `reassignObject` method assigns a new `MyObject` to its parameter `o`, which does not affect the original `obj` reference.

### Summary
Understanding how Java handles passing arguments to methods helps in effectively managing data and avoiding unexpected behavior in your programs. Remember, Java is strictly pass-by-value, but the implications differ between primitive and reference types.

## <u>constructors </u>
Constructors in Java are special methods used to initialize objects. Unlike regular methods, constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type. They are invoked automatically when an object is created using the `new` keyword. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive explanation of constructors in Java:

### Key Features of Constructors

1. **Name**: A constructor must have the same name as the class.
2. **No Return Type**: Constructors do not have a return type, not even `void`.
3. **Automatic Invocation**: Constructors are called automatically when an object is created.
4. **Purpose**: The main purpose of a constructor is to initialize the newly created object.

### Types of Constructors

Java supports different types of constructors:

1. **Default Constructor**
2. **No-Argument Constructor**
3. **Parameterized Constructor**
4. **Copy Constructor** (not a built-in feature but can be implemented)

#### 1. Default Constructor

If no constructor is explicitly defined in a class, the Java compiler provides a default constructor. This constructor has no parameters and initializes object fields with default values (0, null, false, etc.).

#### Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    int value;
    
    // Default constructor is provided by the compiler if no constructor is defined
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        System.out.println(obj.value); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

#### 2. No-Argument Constructor

A no-argument constructor is a constructor that does not take any parameters. If a class already has a constructor, whether default or parameterized, the compiler does not provide the default constructor. If needed, you must explicitly define it.

#### Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    int value;

    // No-argument constructor
    public MyClass() {
        value = 10;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        System.out.println(obj.value); // Output: 10
    }
}
```

#### 3. Parameterized Constructor

A parameterized constructor is one that accepts arguments. This allows you to provide different initial values for objects of the same class.

#### Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    int value;

    // Parameterized constructor
    public MyClass(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj1 = new MyClass(10);
        MyClass obj2 = new MyClass(20);
        System.out.println(obj1.value); // Output: 10
        System.out.println(obj2.value); // Output: 20
    }
}
```

#### 4. Copy Constructor

Java does not provide a built-in copy constructor as in C++, but you can create one to duplicate objects.

#### Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    int value;

    // Parameterized constructor
    public MyClass(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    // Copy constructor
    public MyClass(MyClass other) {
        this.value = other.value;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj1 = new MyClass(10);
        MyClass obj2 = new MyClass(obj1);
        System.out.println(obj2.value); // Output: 10
    }
}
```

### Constructor Overloading

You can define multiple constructors in the same class with different parameter lists. This is called constructor overloading. The appropriate constructor is called based on the arguments passed during object creation.

#### Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    int value;
    String name;

    // No-argument constructor
    public MyClass() {
        value = 0;
        name = "Default";
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public MyClass(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    // Parameterized constructor with different parameters
    public MyClass(int value, String name) {
        this.value = value;
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj1 = new MyClass();
        MyClass obj2 = new MyClass(10);
        MyClass obj3 = new MyClass(20, "John");

        System.out.println(obj1.value + " " + obj1.name); // Output: 0 Default
        System.out.println(obj2.value + " " + obj2.name); // Output: 10 null
        System.out.println(obj3.value + " " + obj3.name); // Output: 20 John
    }
}
```

### Calling One Constructor from Another

You can call one constructor from another using the `this` keyword. This is known as constructor chaining.

#### Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    int value;
    String name;

    // No-argument constructor
    public MyClass() {
        this(0, "Default");
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public MyClass(int value) {
        this(value, "Unknown");
    }

    // Parameterized constructor with different parameters
    public MyClass(int value, String name) {
        this.value = value;
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj1 = new MyClass();
        MyClass obj2 = new MyClass(10);
        MyClass obj3 = new MyClass(20, "John");

        System.out.println(obj1.value + " " + obj1.name); // Output: 0 Default
        System.out.println(obj2.value + " " + obj2.name); // Output: 10 Unknown
        System.out.println(obj3.value + " " + obj3.name); // Output: 20 John
    }
}
```

### Summary

Constructors are a fundamental part of Java programming, enabling the initialization of objects. Understanding how to define and use constructors, including overloading and chaining them, is essential for effective Java development. Constructors ensure that objects are in a valid state when they are created and can be tailored to provide flexibility in how objects are initialized.

## <u>access specifiers </u>
In Java, access specifiers (also known as access modifiers) determine the visibility of classes, methods, and other members. They control where a particular class, method, or variable can be accessed from within the code. Java provides four primary access specifiers:

1. **Public**
2. **Protected**
3. **Default (package-private)**
4. **Private**

### 1. Public

**Keyword:** `public`

**Visibility:**
- Class: Can be accessed from any other class.
- Method/Field: Can be accessed from any other class.

**Usage:**
- When you need to make a class, method, or variable accessible from any other part of your program or even from other programs.

**Example:**
```java
public class MyClass {
    public int value;

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Value: " + value);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.value = 10;
        obj.display(); // Output: Value: 10
    }
}
```

### 2. Protected

**Keyword:** `protected`

**Visibility:**
- Class: Not applicable (cannot be used for top-level classes).
- Method/Field: Can be accessed within the same package and by subclasses in other packages.

**Usage:**
- When you need to allow access to subclasses and other classes in the same package.

**Example:**
```java
package mypackage;

public class MyClass {
    protected int value;

    protected void display() {
        System.out.println("Value: " + value);
    }
}

package anotherpackage;

import mypackage.MyClass;

public class SubClass extends MyClass {
    public void show() {
        value = 10; // Allowed because SubClass is a subclass of MyClass
        display(); // Allowed because SubClass is a subclass of MyClass
    }
}
```

### 3. Default (Package-Private)

**Keyword:** None (default access)

**Visibility:**
- Class: Accessible only within the same package.
- Method/Field: Accessible only within the same package.

**Usage:**
- When you want the access to be limited to the same package.

**Example:**
```java
package mypackage;

class MyClass {
    int value; // default access

    void display() { // default access
        System.out.println("Value: " + value);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.value = 10;
        obj.display(); // Output: Value: 10
    }
}
```

### 4. Private

**Keyword:** `private`

**Visibility:**
- Class: Not applicable (cannot be used for top-level classes).
- Method/Field: Accessible only within the same class.

**Usage:**
- When you need to restrict access to the defining class itself, ensuring encapsulation.

**Example:**
```java
public class MyClass {
    private int value;

    private void display() {
        System.out.println("Value: " + value);
    }

    public void setValue(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        display(); // Allowed because display() is within the same class
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.setValue(10); // Allowed
        // obj.value = 20; // Not allowed, value is private
        // obj.display(); // Not allowed, display() is private
    }
}
```

### Summary of Access Specifiers

| Access Specifier | Class | Package | Subclass | World |
|------------------|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| `public`         | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | Yes   |
| `protected`      | No    | Yes     | Yes      | No    |
| `Default (package-private)` | No    | Yes     | No       | No    |
| `private`        | No    | No      | No       | No    |

### Considerations

- **Encapsulation**: Using private and protected access specifiers helps in encapsulating the details of the implementation, exposing only what is necessary.
- **Inheritance**: Protected access is useful when designing class hierarchies, allowing subclasses to inherit and modify the behavior of their parent classes.
- **Package Design**: Default access specifier (package-private) is beneficial for grouping related classes that should interact with each other without exposing their internal details to the outside world.
- **Security**: Proper use of access specifiers can help in creating secure applications by restricting unauthorized access.

Understanding and appropriately using access specifiers is crucial for designing robust, maintainable, and secure Java applications.

## <u>modifiers </u>
In Java, modifiers are keywords that provide additional information about classes, methods, variables, and other entities in the code. They specify the accessibility, behavior, and characteristics of these entities. Java modifiers can be categorized into several types based on what they modify:

### 1. Class Modifiers

#### `public`
- A `public` class is accessible from any other class.

#### `abstract`
- An `abstract` class cannot be instantiated on its own; it serves as a base for subclasses to extend and implement.

#### `final`
- A `final` class cannot be subclassed. It provides a guarantee that its implementation will not change.

#### `strictfp`
- A `strictfp` class ensures consistent floating-point calculations across different platforms by adhering to the IEEE 754 standard.

#### Example:
```java
public abstract class AbstractClass {
    // Abstract class example
}

public final strictfp class FinalStrictFPClass {
    // Final and strictfp class example
}
```

### 2. Method Modifiers

#### `public`
- A `public` method is accessible from any other class.

#### `protected`
- A `protected` method is accessible within the same package and by subclasses even if they are in different packages.

#### `default` (package-private)
- A method with no modifier (default) is accessible only within the same package.

#### `private`
- A `private` method is accessible only within the same class.

#### `abstract`
- An `abstract` method has no implementation and must be overridden by subclasses.

#### `static`
- A `static` method belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. It can be called directly using the class name.

#### `final`
- A `final` method cannot be overridden by subclasses.

#### `synchronized`
- A `synchronized` method can be accessed by only one thread at a time, ensuring thread safety.

#### `native`
- A `native` method is implemented in native code (e.g., C or C++) and provided by the platform.

#### `strictfp`
- A `strictfp` method ensures consistent floating-point calculations within the method, similar to `strictfp` classes.

#### Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    public void publicMethod() {
        // Public method example
    }

    protected void protectedMethod() {
        // Protected method example
    }

    void defaultMethod() {
        // Default (package-private) method example
    }

    private void privateMethod() {
        // Private method example
    }

    public static void staticMethod() {
        // Static method example
    }

    final void finalMethod() {
        // Final method example
    }

    synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
        // Synchronized method example
    }

    native void nativeMethod();
}
```

### 3. Variable Modifiers

#### `public`
- A `public` variable is accessible from any other class.

#### `protected`
- A `protected` variable is accessible within the same package and by subclasses even if they are in different packages.

#### `default` (package-private)
- A variable with no modifier (default) is accessible only within the same package.

#### `private`
- A `private` variable is accessible only within the same class.

#### `static`
- A `static` variable belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. There is only one copy per class.

#### `final`
- A `final` variable cannot be changed after initialization.

#### `transient`
- A `transient` variable is not serialized when an object is serialized.

#### `volatile`
- A `volatile` variable ensures that threads access its latest updated value, even if accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.

#### Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    public int publicVariable;

    protected int protectedVariable;

    int defaultVariable;

    private int privateVariable;

    public static int staticVariable;

    final int finalVariable = 10;

    transient int transientVariable;

    volatile int volatileVariable;
}
```

### 4. Other Modifiers

#### `abstract`
- Applies to classes, methods, and occasionally to variables. Denotes that a method or class does not have implementation details.

#### `final`
- Can be used with classes, methods, and variables. For classes, it prevents inheritance. For methods, it prevents overriding. For variables, it prevents reassignment after initialization.

#### `static`
- Can be used with methods, variables, and inner classes. Denotes that the method, variable, or class belongs to the class rather than instances of the class.

#### `synchronized`
- Applies to methods and blocks. Ensures that only one thread can access the synchronized method or block at a time.

#### `transient`
- Applies to instance variables. Prevents the variable from being serialized when the object is serialized.

#### `volatile`
- Applies to instance variables. Ensures that the variable is always read and written directly from main memory, useful in multithreaded environments to ensure visibility of changes across threads.

#### `strictfp`
- Can be used with classes and methods. Ensures consistent floating-point calculations across different platforms.

#### `native`
- Applies to methods. Indicates that the method is implemented in native code (e.g., C or C++) provided by the platform.

### Summary

Modifiers in Java provide flexibility and control over classes, methods, variables, and other entities, influencing their accessibility, behavior, and characteristics. Understanding when and how to use these modifiers is crucial for designing robust, maintainable, and efficient Java programs. Each modifier serves a specific purpose, from ensuring encapsulation and thread safety to controlling inheritance and preventing modification.

## <u>, the main() method </u>
In Java, `main()` is a special method that serves as the entry point for any standalone Java application. When you execute a Java program using the `java` command, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for the `main()` method as the starting point of execution. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive explanation of the `main()` method in Java:

### Key Features of `main()` Method

1. **Signature**:
   - The `main()` method has a specific signature:
     ```java
     public static void main(String[] args)
     ```
   - It must be `public` so that the JVM can access it.
   - It must be `static` so that the JVM can call it without creating an instance of the class.
   - It has a `void` return type, meaning it does not return any value.

2. **Parameters**:
   - The `main()` method accepts a single parameter of type `String[]` (array of `String`), conventionally named `args`.
   - This parameter allows command-line arguments to be passed to the Java program when it is executed.

3. **Execution**:
   - When you run a Java program (`java YourClassName`), the JVM looks for the `main()` method in the specified class (`YourClassName`).
   - It then executes the statements inside the `main()` method sequentially.

### Usage and Examples

#### Basic Example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
- In this example, `main()` is the starting point of execution.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` is the statement executed when the program runs.
- The output of this program will be:
  ```
  Hello, World!
  ```

#### Command-Line Arguments:

```java
public class CommandLineArgs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Number of arguments: " + args.length);
        for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Argument " + (i + 1) + ": " + args[i]);
        }
    }
}
```
- When you run `java CommandLineArgs arg1 arg2 arg3`, the `main()` method receives `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3` as elements of the `args` array.
- Output will be:
  ```
  Number of arguments: 3
  Argument 1: arg1
  Argument 2: arg2
  Argument 3: arg3
  ```

#### Variations:

- The `main()` method can also be overloaded (having multiple definitions with different parameters), but the JVM will only recognize `public static void main(String[] args)` as the entry point.

### Summary

The `main()` method in Java is crucial for starting the execution of a Java application. It has a fixed signature (`public static void main(String[] args)`) and serves as the entry point where program execution begins. It accepts command-line arguments via the `args` parameter, allowing for customization of program behavior based on inputs provided at runtime. Understanding and properly implementing the `main()` method is essential for developing and running Java applications effectively.

## <u>Overloading </u>
Overloading in Java refers to the ability to define multiple methods in the same class with the same name but with different parameters. This allows methods to perform similar tasks using different inputs. Overloading is a form of polymorphism in Java where a single method name can be used to perform different actions depending on the parameters passed to it.

### Rules for Method Overloading

1. **Same Method Name**: Overloaded methods must have the same name.

2. **Different Parameters**:
   - Number of parameters must differ.
   - Type of parameters must differ.
   - Order of parameters must differ (if of the same type).

3. **Return Type**: The return type of overloaded methods can be different, but it alone is not sufficient to distinguish overloaded methods. Java uses the method signature (method name + parameter list) to determine which method to call.

### Example of Method Overloading

```java
public class Calculator {
    // Method to add two integers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add three integers
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add two doubles
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to concatenate two strings
    public String add(String a, String b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

In this example:
- There are four `add` methods in the `Calculator` class.
- They all have the same name (`add`) but differ in the number and/or types of parameters they accept.
- Java determines which method to call based on the number and types of arguments passed during method invocation.

### Method Overloading vs Method Overriding

- **Method Overloading**:
  - Occurs within the same class.
  - Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
  - Decision on which method to call is made at compile-time (static polymorphism or early binding).

- **Method Overriding**:
  - Occurs in a subclass and involves a method with the same signature (name and parameters) as a method in its superclass.
  - Used to provide specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass.
  - Decision on which method to call is made at runtime (dynamic polymorphism or late binding).

### Benefits of Method Overloading

- **Readability**: Provides a clear and concise way to define methods that perform similar tasks but on different types or numbers of inputs.
  
- **Flexibility**: Allows developers to use the same method name for methods that logically belong together, improving code organization and readability.

- **Code Reuse**: Encourages code reuse by eliminating the need for different method names to perform similar operations with different parameters.

### Considerations

- **Ambiguity**: Methods with the same name and parameter types cannot be overloaded. Java will generate a compilation error if it cannot determine which method to call based on the arguments passed.

- **Return Type**: Overloaded methods can have different return types, but this alone is not sufficient to distinguish overloaded methods.

### Summary

Method overloading in Java provides a way to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class. It enhances code readability, flexibility, and promotes code reuse by allowing methods to perform similar tasks on different inputs. Understanding the rules and benefits of method overloading is fundamental for effective Java programming and designing well-structured applications.

## <u>Relationship between classes </u>
In Java, the relationships between classes define how different classes are connected or associated with each other in a program. These relationships are crucial for building complex systems and implementing various object-oriented principles like inheritance, composition, and association. Let's explore the main types of relationships between classes in Java:

### 1. Association

**Association** represents a relationship where one class is related to another class in some way. It can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship. Associations are typically represented as instance variables in the classes involved.

- **Example**: A `Car` class may have an association with a `Driver` class, where each car has a driver.

```java
public class Car {
    private Driver driver; // Association with Driver class

    public Car(Driver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }
}
```

### 2. Aggregation

**Aggregation** is a specialized form of association where one class is a part or a "whole-part" relationship with another class. It implies a weaker relationship where the parts can exist independently of the whole.

- **Example**: A `Department` class may aggregate `Employee` objects.

```java
public class Department {
    private List<Employee> employees; // Aggregation of Employee objects

    public Department() {
        this.employees = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
        employees.add(employee);
    }
}
```

### 3. Composition

**Composition** is a stronger form of aggregation where the parts are dependent on the whole and cannot exist without it. It implies a "contains-a" relationship.

- **Example**: A `House` class may compose `Room` objects.

```java
public class House {
    private List<Room> rooms; // Composition of Room objects

    public House() {
        this.rooms = new ArrayList<>();
        rooms.add(new Room("Living Room"));
        rooms.add(new Room("Bedroom"));
    }
}
```

### 4. Inheritance

**Inheritance** is an "is-a" relationship where a subclass (derived class) inherits behavior and properties from a superclass (base class). It allows code reuse and facilitates polymorphism.

- **Example**: A `Rectangle` class inherits from a `Shape` class.

```java
public class Shape {
    // Common properties and methods
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    // Additional properties and methods specific to Rectangle
}
```

### 5. Dependency

**Dependency** is a relationship where one class depends on another class through method parameters, local variables, or return types. It indicates that one class uses functionality provided by another class.

- **Example**: A `Client` class depends on a `Service` class to perform some operations.

```java
public class Client {
    private Service service;

    public Client(Service service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        service.execute(); // Dependency on Service class
    }
}
```

### Summary

Understanding and properly implementing these relationships between classes in Java is fundamental to designing robust and maintainable object-oriented systems. Each type of relationship serves a different purpose and helps in organizing classes effectively, promoting code reuse, and ensuring flexibility and scalability in software development. Choosing the appropriate type of relationship depends on the specific requirements and design considerations of your application.
